# Simulation to Real-world transfer

This is the final project of the Robot Learning (01HFNOV) exam @ Politecnico di Torino.

### How to run on Colab

This repository uses the `mujoco-py` library, that is compatible only with Python versions up to 3.10.

To run it on Colab using this Python version, go to `access tools > command palette > use fallback runtime environment`.

This is needed because Colab updated the runtime environment to a newer version that is not compatible with the current version of `mujoco-py` right after the completion of this project.
